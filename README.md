# Frogger Reloaded

FroggerReloaded is a old game of mine written in C#. 
The goals of the game is to get the frog to the other side of the screen. 
But watch out for the cars and the water because this frog cannot swim. 
So try to stay on the trees while crossing the river.

You can move the frog with the W,A,S,D keys on your keyboard. 
W-key is forward, A left, D right and S backwards.
