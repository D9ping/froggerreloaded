There are some known issue's with 1.0.0 release.<br />
- Glitch with the frog standing on the tree.<br />
- If you start the game with a limited windows user account.<br />
The application data folder with levels and highscores cannot be found.<br />Because the installer save them to the application data folder of the user running the installer.
Start the game as administrator on FroggerReloaded 1.0.0. Or update to  FroggerReloaded 1.0.1 which does not have this issue anymore.<br />

The sourcecode archive of 1.0.1 release does not contains the documentation folder. As the documentation is outdated.
